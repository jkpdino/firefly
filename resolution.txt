Name resolution will now take place as the AST is being lowered.

It consists of two steps:
1. Creating the namespace tree
2. Actually resolving things based on it.

Creating the namespace tree is the hardest part. A namespace is a collection of symbols, with an associated name and visibility. A namespace can have a parent or not.

(root namespace)
    (package rt)
        (package numerical)
            (file Integer.fly)
                (struct Int)

                (extension Int with Addable)
                    (import struct Int)

Namespace
    id: Id<Namespace>
    parent: Option<Id<Namespace>>

    imports: Vec<Import>
    symbols: Vec<SymbolDef>

Import
    visibility: Visibility
    namespace:  Id<Namespace>

SymbolDef
    visibility: Visibility
    name:       String
    symbol:     Symbol
